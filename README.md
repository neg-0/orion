## Human Oversight

While Orion is designed to operate autonomously, it maintains several checkpoints for human oversight:

1. **Improvement Proposals**:
   - Review and approve proposed changes
   - Modify improvement priorities
   - Add constraints or requirements

2. **Design Review**:
   - Evaluate architectural decisions
   - Provide design guidance
   - Set design constraints

3. **Code Review**:
   - Review generated code
   - Suggest modifications
   - Approve/reject changes

4. **Deployment Approval**:
   - Control deployment timing
   - Set deployment constraints
   - Monitor deployment impact

This README file provides a comprehensive overview of Orion, including installation instructions, usage guidelines, and project details. It should help users understand and contribute to the project effectively.
