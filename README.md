## Usage

1. **User Inputs Prompt**:

   - The user provides an initial text prompt describing the desired software application.

2. **System Analyzes Prompt**:

   - The AI analyzes the prompt and generates requirements and design documents.

3. **Code Generation**:

   - The AI generates the source code based on the requirements and design.

4. **Testing**:

   - The AI generates and runs tests on the code.
   - Reports any issues or errors found during testing.

5. **Deployment**:

   - The AI sets up CI/CD pipelines and deploys the application.

6. **Maintenance**:

   - The AI monitors the application, logs issues, and performs updates as necessary.

7. **User Interaction**:
   - The user can monitor the project's progress, review documentation, and provide feedback.
   - The user can intervene at any point to adjust or redirect the development process.
