## Communication Rules

1. **Chain of Command**
   - All major decisions go through Coordinator Agent
   - Agents can communicate directly for predefined workflows
   - Emergency protocols allow direct communication

2. **State Management**
   - All state changes are broadcast
   - State updates are versioned
   - Conflicts are resolved by Coordinator

3. **Error Handling**
   - Errors are reported to Coordinator
   - Retry logic is built into workflows
   - Fallback procedures are defined
