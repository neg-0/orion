## Implementation Notes

### Development Principles
- Each milestone should be feature-complete before moving to the next
- All features must have corresponding tests
- Documentation should be updated alongside code changes
- Code reviews required for all major changes
- Regular security audits throughout development

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for agent interactions
- End-to-end tests for complete workflows
- Performance testing for critical paths
- Security testing at each milestone

### Quality Gates
- 80% test coverage minimum
- All linter rules passed
- No known security vulnerabilities
- Documentation updated
- Performance benchmarks met

### Deployment Strategy
- Continuous Integration with automated tests
- Staged deployments (dev → staging → prod)
- Automated rollback capabilities
- Monitoring and alerting in place

## Success Criteria
- All milestones completed with passing tests
- System capable of autonomous code improvements
- Human oversight mechanisms in place
- Documentation complete and up-to-date
- Performance metrics met
- Security requirements satisfied
