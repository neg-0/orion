## Implementation Principles

1. **Modularity**
   - Each component should be self-contained
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Dependency injection for better testing

2. **Testing**
   - Test-driven development (TDD) approach
   - Comprehensive test coverage
   - Integration tests for component interactions

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep documentation close to code
   - Update docs with code changes
   - Include examples and use cases

4. **Code Quality**
   - Follow TypeScript best practices
   - Consistent code style
   - Regular code reviews

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Implementation Roadmap](./roadmap.md) for the current development status
2. Check the [Architecture Overview](./architecture.md) for system design
3. Read relevant agent specifications in [Agent Specifications](../agents/README.md)
4. Follow setup instructions in the root README.md

## Contributing

When contributing to the implementation:

1. Create a new branch for your feature
2. Follow the testing guidelines
3. Update relevant documentation
4. Submit a pull request with a clear description
5. Ensure CI checks pass
