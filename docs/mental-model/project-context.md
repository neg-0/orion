## Project Purpose

Orion is designed to be a self-improving development system that can:
1. Understand its own architecture and codebase
2. Identify areas for improvement
3. Implement and validate changes
4. Learn from its experiences

## Core Principles

1. **Self-Improvement**
   - The system should continuously evolve
   - Changes should be measurable and beneficial
   - Learning should be cumulative

2. **Agent Autonomy**
   - Agents should make independent decisions
   - Coordination through clear protocols
   - Fail-safe mechanisms required

3. **Human Collaboration**
   - Clear oversight points
   - Transparent decision-making
   - Explainable actions

## Mental Models

### System Self-Awareness
- The system maintains an up-to-date model of its own architecture
- Components register capabilities and dependencies
- State and health monitoring is continuous

### Code Understanding
- Code is mapped to functional purposes
- Dependencies are tracked with their rationale
- Technical debt is actively monitored

### Improvement Process
- Changes are proposed based on clear metrics
- Impact is predicted before implementation
- Results are measured and recorded
