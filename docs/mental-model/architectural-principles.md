## Core Architecture Principles

1. **Agent Independence**
   - Each agent has a clear, single responsibility
   - Agents communicate through well-defined interfaces
   - Agents can be updated/replaced independently

2. **Observable System**
   - All important state changes are logged
   - Metrics are collected automatically
   - Decision points are documented

3. **Reversible Changes**
   - All changes can be rolled back
   - State transitions are atomic
   - History is preserved

4. **Knowledge Persistence**
   - Learning is stored in accessible formats
   - Context is preserved with decisions
   - Patterns are documented as they emerge

## Design Patterns

### Agent Communication
```yaml
pattern: pub-sub
purpose: agent-coordination
implementation: event-driven
```

### State Management
```yaml
pattern: immutable-state
purpose: traceability
implementation: event-sourcing
```

### Learning Storage
```yaml
pattern: knowledge-graph
purpose: context-preservation
implementation: graph-database
```
